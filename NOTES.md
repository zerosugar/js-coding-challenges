# Who is this for?

* People wanting to work on coding problems
* People preparing for bootcamps
* Both to learn and to prep for interviews
* Reduce the friction around / get used to using using git and testing

# Problem Repo

Github Repo for the problems
Travis CI runs tests on pull requests

* Tests in `tests` directory
* Problems in the `problems` directory

# Website

Website to explain the process
Website to take gitub logins / signups
Website signup triggers gitub repo branch

# Questions to figure out

* Is there a way to auto merge?
* How to handle incorrect answers, additional commits
* Will I need a separate repo for the source code to keep all the PR requests from people submitting challenges separate from the PR requests from people submitting new code? This probably isn't an MVP issue.

# Roadmap

* Start with one toy problem
* Get npm test working with only most recently changed files
* Add CONTRIBUTING.md document
  * Add documentation on the naming scheme of exercise vs test files
  * Provide a template for creating new exercises

# Bits of Potentially Helpful Code

List filenames of changes since your most recent commit:

	git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD
	git diff --name-only HEAD^ # include uncommitted changes
	git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD -- exercises # filter?

Mocha grep:

	mocha --grep 'testFilter'
